# Sentrifarm

Sentrifarm will provide a simple and effective management tool to Australia farmers
* sentrifarm informs the farmer withat a glance whether it is safe to harvest any crop
* sentrifarm provides realtime and historical data on weather, crop and astronomical conditions
* sentrifarm is self sufficient for power (solar) and communications (not reliant on the GSM network)
* sentrifarm is designed to be modular and expandable

# Background
Farming in Australia presents many unique challenges.
Not least are our summer climactic conditions: high temperatures, strong winds and dry soil and vegetation.
Together these provide the ingredients for a disaster such as the [2015 Samson Flat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Sampson_Flat_bushfires)
fires that burned nearly 50000 acres and destroyed houses and businesses and farmland in country
not that far northeast of Adelaide.
Broadacre farming presents particular hazards:
* grain harvest is often due over the summer December - January
period,
* many past fires have been started by 'headers' -
the large [combine harvesters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combine_harvester#Combine_heads)
used to reap and collect the ripened grain
* a crop fire started by a header will move incredibly fast,
destroying unharvested crop and able to morph into a full scale bushfire if farmland borders scrubby hills or forest.

To remain safe a farmer must rely on more than official weather forecasts:
* Australian farms can have _large_ paddocks. 200 acres may be 'small'
* Dry soil or vegetation amplifies ambient temperature effects
* The [Grass Fire Danger Index](http://www.csiro.au/en/Research/Environment/Extreme-Events/Bushfire/Fire-danger-meters/Grass-fire-danger-meter) is a more accurate predictor of dangerous conditions 
* Variable and windy conditions means the weather can vary from one side of a paddock to the other!
* The farmer must directly check conditions on each and every paddock before deploying their header
* This usually means driving out, which consumes time, and fuel. Paddocks in Australia are often geographically disparate as well as large.
